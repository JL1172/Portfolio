    description : `I am currently a student at Bloom Institute of Technology for Full-stack web development and I am a
    student at GCU pursuing a Bachelors in Accounting(public-accounting). I love not only the technical
    expertise software engineering demands, but the ability to be hands on with a project that can make a
    difference in the world, in the lives of many or few. I am a team player and highly self-motivated and
    driven to exceed expectations and deliver results. I am passionate about software engineering and
    development. I love what I do and I love the always moving, ever progressing nature of web
    development. I love customer satisfaction and crushing expectations, and I love the fact that there is
    always something new to learn.`
